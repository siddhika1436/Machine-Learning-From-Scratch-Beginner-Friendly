# Machine-Learning-From-Scratch-Beginner-Friendly-
This repository is created while learning Machine Learning from the basics. Each topic is written in a separate Jupyter notebook with clear markdown explanations, comments, and step-by-step code so that beginners can easily understand why and how things work.  The goal of this repo is learning, not shortcuts.
